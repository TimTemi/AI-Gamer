# AI Gamer with Deep Learning Models

## Overview

AI Gamer is a project focused on developing AI agents capable of playing Atari video games using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQN). This project aims to demonstrate the application of deep learning in solving complex gaming environments and achieving superior performance compared to traditional methods.

## Features

- Three distinct models implemented for playing Atari games: Cart Pole, Space Invaders, and Pacman.
- Utilizes OpenAI Gym environment and Stable Baselines3 library for model training and evaluation.
- Customizable reinforcement learning algorithms and hyperparameters for optimal performance.
